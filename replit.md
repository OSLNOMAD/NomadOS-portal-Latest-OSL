# Nomad Internet Customer Portal

## Overview
The Nomad Internet Customer Portal is a web application designed to provide Nomad Internet customers with a modern, feature-rich platform for managing their services. It includes full authentication, subscription management, order tracking, invoicing, and device management capabilities. The portal aims to enhance the customer experience by offering self-service options and detailed insights into their internet services.

## User Preferences
I prefer detailed explanations, especially for complex features or architectural decisions. I want to be informed before major changes are made to the codebase. I expect iterative development with clear communication at each step.

## System Architecture
The portal is built with a React frontend, an Express.js backend, and a PostgreSQL database utilizing Drizzle ORM. Styling is managed with Tailwind CSS, and animations are handled by Framer Motion. Authentication is JWT-based with bcrypt for password hashing and OTP verification for sign-up and sign-in.

### UI/UX Decisions
The design adheres to official Nomad Internet branding, featuring a modern SaaS aesthetic. Key elements include a glassmorphism card design, gradient panels, Inter font, and a distinct color palette with `#10a37f` as the primary brand green. User interactions are designed with large input fields, gradient buttons, and visual feedback for actions. The dashboard features a tabbed interface for various sections like Overview, Subscriptions, Orders, Invoices, and Internet.

### Technical Implementations
- **Authentication**: Supports traditional email/password and OTP-based passwordless sign-in. The sign-up process includes multi-step verification via phone and email OTP. Password reset is also OTP-verified.
- **Customer Data Aggregation**: A unified service layer integrates data from multiple external APIs (Chargebee, Shopify, Shipstation, ThingSpace) to provide a comprehensive view of customer information, subscriptions, orders, and device statuses.
- **Subscription & Billing**: Displays detailed subscription information, including ICCID/IMEI/MDN. Integrates with Chargebee for invoice viewing, payment collection, and payment method management. Supports subscription-grouped invoices and bulk payment options.
- **Device Management**: The "Internet" tab provides real-time line status indicators from ThingSpace. It supports changing device plans and includes a dedicated troubleshooting page for line restoration with automated recovery attempts and escalation options.
- **AI Chatbot**: An integrated JADA AI chatbot powered by OpenAI GPT-4o provides customer support with contextual awareness of the user's account data.
- **Activity Tracking**: Logs user login history and other account activities.

### Feature Specifications
- **Sign-Up Flow**: Email validation (local DB & Chargebee), phone number collection with OTP, email OTP verification, full name and password creation, auto-login.
- **Sign-In Methods**: Password-based and OTP (passwordless) authentication.
- **Forgot Password Flow**: Email-based OTP verification, secure reset token issuance, new password creation.
- **Account Management**: Users can update their name, password, and phone number (with OTP verification).
- **Dashboard**: Centralized view with tabs for Overview, Subscriptions (hierarchical view for multiple customers), Orders (combined Shopify/Shipstation data), Invoices (with payment options), and Internet (device status, plan changes, troubleshooting).
- **Troubleshooting**: Automated line status checks, suspended line auto-restoration, escalation to support with ticket tracking, and issue-specific guidance for active lines.
