# Nomad Internet Customer Portal

## Overview
The Nomad Internet Customer Portal is a web application providing Nomad Internet customers with a modern platform to manage their services. It offers comprehensive features including authentication, subscription management, order tracking, invoicing, and device management. The portal aims to enhance the customer experience through self-service options and detailed insights into their internet services, solidifying Nomad Internet's position in the market with a robust and user-friendly digital interface.

## User Preferences
I prefer detailed explanations, especially for complex features or architectural decisions. I want to be informed before major changes are made to the codebase. I expect iterative development with clear communication at each step.

## System Architecture
The portal is built with a React frontend, an Express.js backend, and a PostgreSQL database utilizing Drizzle ORM. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, and Framer Motion for animations. Authentication is JWT-based, incorporating bcrypt for password hashing and OTP verification for sign-up and sign-in processes.

### UI/UX Decisions
The design adheres to Nomad Internet's official branding with a modern SaaS aesthetic. Key visual elements include glassmorphism card designs, gradient panels, the Inter font, and a distinct color palette featuring `#10a37f` as the primary brand green. User interactions are optimized with large input fields, gradient buttons, and clear visual feedback. The dashboard is organized with a tabbed interface for easy navigation through sections like Overview, Subscriptions, Orders, Invoices, and Internet.

### Technical Implementations
- **Authentication**: Supports both email/password and OTP-based passwordless sign-in, with a multi-step OTP verification process for sign-up and password reset.
- **Customer Data Aggregation**: A unified service layer integrates data from multiple external APIs (Chargebee, Shopify, Shipstation, ThingSpace) to provide a holistic view of customer information, subscriptions, orders, and device statuses.
- **Subscription & Billing**: Displays detailed subscription information, including ICCID/IMEI/MDN, and integrates with Chargebee for invoice viewing, payment collection, and payment method management, supporting subscription-grouped invoices and bulk payments.
- **Device Management**: The "Internet" tab offers real-time line status from ThingSpace, supports changing device plans, and includes a troubleshooting page for line restoration with automated recovery attempts and escalation options. Features also include device help options and comprehensive slow speed troubleshooting.
- **AI Chatbot**: An integrated JADA AI chatbot, powered by OpenAI GPT-4o, provides contextual customer support.
- **Activity Tracking**: Logs user login history and other account activities for enhanced security and user transparency.
- **Cancellation & Retention Flow**: Implements a multi-step cancellation modal with intelligent flows based on user reasons, offering retention discounts or troubleshooting, and integrating with Zendesk and Slack for support.
- **Customer Feedback System**: Allows customers to submit and view feedback, with an admin interface for management and response.
- **Credit Notes & Refunds Visibility**: Fetches and displays credit notes from Chargebee, providing detailed views and PDF downloads.
- **Add-on Management**: Customers can add and remove subscription add-ons (e.g., Travel Add-on) via a dedicated modal. Features de-duplication logic for Travel add-on variants, upsell-biased UI encouraging add-on purchases, and retention messaging discouraging removal. Backend verifies subscription ownership before any changes.
- **External API Logging**: All outgoing requests to external services (Chargebee, Shopify, Shipstation, ThingSpace) are logged via a `loggedFetch` wrapper in services.ts, capturing service name, endpoint, method, status code, response time, success/failure, customer email, and trigger source. Logs are stored in the `external_api_logs` database table and viewable in the Admin Dashboard's "API Logs" tab with filtering by service and CSV export.
- **Rate Limiting**: In-memory rate limiting middleware protects customer-facing API routes from spam/reload abuse. Three tiers: `heavyApiLimiter` (3 requests/60s for full-data loads, device actions, add-on operations), `customerApiLimiter` (5 requests/30s for device status, plans, chat), and `authLimiter` (10 requests/60s for sign-in, OTP, password reset). Returns HTTP 429 with retry-after header when exceeded.

### Feature Specifications
