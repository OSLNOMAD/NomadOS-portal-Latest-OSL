# Nomad Internet Customer Portal

## Overview
The Nomad Internet Customer Portal is a web application providing Nomad Internet customers with a modern platform to manage their services. It offers comprehensive features including authentication, subscription management, order tracking, invoicing, and device management. The portal aims to enhance the customer experience through self-service options and detailed insights into their internet services, solidifying Nomad Internet's position in the market with a robust and user-friendly digital interface.

## User Preferences
I prefer detailed explanations, especially for complex features or architectural decisions. I want to be informed before major changes are made to the codebase. I expect iterative development with clear communication at each step.

## System Architecture
The portal is built with a React frontend, an Express.js backend, and a PostgreSQL database utilizing Drizzle ORM. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, and Framer Motion for animations. Authentication is JWT-based, incorporating bcrypt for password hashing and OTP verification for sign-up and sign-in processes.

### UI/UX Decisions
The design adheres to Nomad Internet's official branding with a modern SaaS aesthetic. Key visual elements include glassmorphism card designs, gradient panels, the Inter font, and a distinct color palette featuring `#10a37f` as the primary brand green. User interactions are optimized with large input fields, gradient buttons, and clear visual feedback. The dashboard is organized with a tabbed interface for easy navigation through sections like Overview, Subscriptions, Orders, Invoices, and Internet.
