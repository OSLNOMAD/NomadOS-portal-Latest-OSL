```

## Database Schema
- **customers**: email, phone, password hash, verification status, Chargebee ID, login tracking
- **otp_codes**: 6-digit codes with 10-minute expiration, types (phone/email/signin)
- **sessions**: JWT tokens with 7-day expiration

## API Documentation
See `docs/API-DOCUMENTATION.md` for detailed information about all external API integrations including:
- Chargebee (billing, subscriptions, invoices, transactions)
- Shopify Admin API (orders, fulfillments)
- Shipstation (shipping, tracking, IMEI/ICCID custom fields)
- ThingSpace (Verizon device management)

## Sign-Up Flow
1. **Email Step**: User enters email, checked against local database first
   - If user exists with password, shows message to sign in instead with links to Sign In and Forgot Password
   - If not in local DB, checks against Chargebee API
2. **Confirm Email**: If not found in Chargebee, asks user to confirm or try different email
3. **Phone Step**: Collects US phone number (+1 format with validation)
4. **Phone OTP**: Backend generates 6-digit OTP, sends via Twilio, user enters code
5. **Email OTP**: Backend generates 6-digit OTP, sends via Twilio, user enters code
6. **Full Name + Password**: User enters full name and creates password (min 8 characters)
7. **Auto-login**: User is automatically logged in and redirected to dashboard

## Sign-In Methods
1. **Password**: Traditional email + password authentication
2. **OTP (Passwordless)**: Email OTP sent, verified, then logged in

## Forgot Password Flow
1. **Email Step**: User enters email, OTP sent with indicator "Email OTP forgot password"
2. **Verify OTP**: User enters 6-digit code, server issues secure reset token (15-min expiry)
3. **Reset Password**: User creates new password, reset token validated and invalidated after use
4. **Success**: User redirected to sign in with new password
